## Clear/Reset CMOS Methods
* CMOS Reset Button (if available):
  * Some motherboards have a dedicated CMOS reset button.
  * Locate the button on the motherboard.
  * Power off the computer and press the button for a few seconds.
* Jumper Method:
  * Locate the CMOS jumper on the motherboard.
  * Power off the computer.
  * Move the jumper from its default position to the clear position.
  * Wait for a few seconds, then move the jumper back to its original position.
* Battery Removal:
  * Power off the computer and disconnect it from the power source.
  * Locate the CMOS battery on the motherboard.
  * Remove the CMOS battery carefully.
  * Wait for about 5-10 minutes, then reinsert the battery.
* Power Drain Method:
  * Power off the computer and unplug it.
  * Press and hold the power button for 15-20 seconds.
  * Reconnect the power and turn on the computer.
* BIOS/UEFI Settings:
  * Enter the BIOS/UEFI settings during system boot (usually by pressing DEL, F2, or another key).
  * Navigate to the "Reset to default" or "Load optimized defaults" option.
  * Save changes and exit.

# ===== Troubleshooting =====

* Issue: "EZ Debug LED" shows/displays the "VGA" LED light - No display and "failure to boot into UEFI/BIOS."
  * Solutions:
    * Check if your CPU supports iGPU (Integrated Graphics); attempt to get output from the motherboard instead of the GPU.
    * Verify cable connections; ensure all are securely in place.
    * Attempt taking out the GPU, cleaning the pins, and blowing out all dust etc then reinserting the GPU.
    * Troubleshoot RAM issues; try booting with 1 or 2 RAM sticks, testing different sticks as one may be faulty.
    * Clear the CMOS.
    * If the motherboard is potentially bricked, update the UEFI/BIOS by placing a fresh image on a flash drive. Connect it to the Flash BIOS port in the I/O port area and use the Flash BIOS Button if available. If you don't have this option, you will have to aquire a new motherboard.
    * If possible, check how the GPU acts in another currently working system.
