<summary>Cleaning Computer Parts</summary>

## Isopropyl Alcohol

**Usage:**
- Ideal for cleaning electronic components, including CPUs, GPUs, and connectors.
- Effective for removing thermal paste and dust buildup.

**Application:**
1. Dampen a lint-free cloth or cotton swab with isopropyl alcohol.
2. Gently wipe the surfaces, ensuring thorough cleaning.
3. Allow components to dry completely before reassembly.

**Note:**
- Use a high-percentage isopropyl alcohol (at least 90%) for better results.
- Ensure the computer is powered off and unplugged before cleaning.

<details>
<summary>Compressed Air</summary>

## Usage

- Effective for removing dust from hard-to-reach areas, fans, and heat sinks.

## Application

1. Hold fans in place to prevent them from spinning during cleaning.
2. Use short bursts of compressed air to blow away dust.
3. Pay attention to vents, heatsinks, and other components with dust buildup.

## Note

- Use the compressed air in a well-ventilated area.
- Hold fans in place to prevent them from spinning during cleaning.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Cotton Swabs</summary>

## Usage

- Useful for detailed cleaning of small components and connectors.

## Application

1. Dampen the cotton swab with isopropyl alcohol.
2. Gently clean connectors, ports, and other small components.
3. Dispose of swabs after use to prevent cross-contamination.

## Note

- Be gentle to avoid damaging delicate components.
- Use a new swab for each cleaning session.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Lint-Free Cloths</summary>

## Usage

- Suitable for wiping down surfaces without leaving lint or fibers.

## Application

1. Dampen the lint-free cloth with isopropyl alcohol.
2. Wipe down surfaces, including the exterior of the computer case.
3. Ensure thorough drying before reassembly.

## Note

- Avoid using regular paper towels, as they may leave debris.

## Internet Service Provider (ISP)

* [Speed Test](https://librespeed.org/)

<details>
<summary>Common Scams</summary>

* **MBps and Mbps Deception:**
  ISPs may deceive users by advertising Mbps (Megabits per second) instead of MBps (Megabytes per second), which is eight times smaller. This can lead to confusion about actual internet speeds. Be vigilant and read the fine print for informed decisions.
  | Mb/s (Megabit per second) | MB/s (Megabyte per second) |
  |-|-|
  | 300 | 37.5 |
  | 500 | 62.5 |
  | 1000 (1 Gig) | 125 |
  | 2000 (2 Gig) | 250 |
  | 5000 (5 Gig) | 625 |

* **Introductory Rates:**
  ISPs often offer attractive introductory rates that later increase significantly. Users may sign up for a seemingly affordable plan, only to face higher bills after the initial period.

* **Hidden Fees:**
  Additional fees, such as equipment rental charges or installation fees, may not be clearly disclosed upfront, contributing to unexpected costs for users.

* **Data Caps:**
  Some ISPs impose data caps on users, limiting the amount of data they can use each month. These caps may not be prominently highlighted, leading to unexpected overage charges.

* **Throttling:**
  ISPs may engage in data throttling, slowing down internet speeds for specific activities like streaming or file sharing. This practice might not be clearly communicated to users.

* **Unreliable Speed Guarantees:**
  Speed guarantees in ISP contracts may come with disclaimers, allowing for variations in service. Users may not receive the consistently high speeds they expect.

* **Contract Lengths:**
  Long-term contracts with hefty termination fees can lock users into agreements without adequate flexibility. Clear information about contract terms may be buried in the fine print.

* **Limited Competition:**
  In areas with limited ISP options, companies may not feel the pressure to provide competitive pricing or improved services, leaving users with fewer alternatives.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>EZ Debug LED shows "VGA" LED light - No display and failure to boot into UEFI/BIOS</summary>

**Solutions:**

- Check if your CPU supports iGPU (Integrated Graphics); attempt to get output from the motherboard instead of the GPU.
- Verify cable connections; ensure all are securely in place.
- Attempt taking out the GPU, cleaning the pins, and blowing out all dust, etc., then reinserting the GPU.
- Troubleshoot RAM issues; try booting with 1 or 2 RAM sticks, testing different sticks as one may be faulty.
- Clear the CMOS.
- If the motherboard is potentially bricked, update the UEFI/BIOS by placing a fresh image on a flash drive. Connect it to the Flash BIOS port in the I/O port area and use the Flash BIOS Button if available. If you don't have this option, you will have to acquire a new motherboard.
- If possible, check how the GPU acts in another currently working system.
